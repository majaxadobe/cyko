Notes:
*Rate Control*
  Target Quality choose from 25-30 for example on "Value" inputbox set 26
    the higher the quality value the lower the quality but higher the file size
  Target Bitrate choose from 300-500 for example on "Value" inputbox set 400
    the higher the bitrate value the higher the quality but higher the file size
*Height*
  choose from 400, 480, 576 (this is 400p, 480p, 576p)
  cyko (specifically Handbrake) do not allow upscaling so if your source is not
  720p for example once you set 720p on the "Height" inputbox it will be automatically
  set to the actual height pixel resolution of the source
*Audio Bitrate*
  choose from 48-99 for example 48 is the recommend choice
     the higher the audio bitrate the higher the quality but higher the file size
*HardSubs*
  check this always
*Presets*
  always go for "High Quality" at the cost of longer re-encoding time

then if the re-encoding is finished it will show you this message box

this means that the output files are in the same place where the input files are, just with added "-OUT" on its filename 

NOTE: if ever you are prompted by this message box

it means that you should place HandbrakeCLI.exe on the same place Cyko is in so check the "installing cyko" section at the top of this guide again 

and that is all folks, congrats on re-encoding
