#summary what are the changes to cyko

* 05-09-11 *
  * when "Hard Subs" is checked it will output to mp4, you may wonder what if the source file has no subs at all so will checking "Hard Subs" still output to mp4? the answer is yes

* 05-08-11 *
  * added "--mixdown mono" for encoding FLAC 6 channel audio to low bitrates

* 04-29-11 *
  * added b-adapt=2 on presets "medium quality" and "high quality"

* 04-27-11 *
  * changed the presets to be more balance on speed and quality

   Hight Quality -> deblock=1,1:ref=8:bframes=5:me=umh:subme=10:trellis=2:psy-rd=0.0:aq-strength=0.6:aq-mode=2
   
   Medium Quality -> deblock=1,1:ref=5:bframes=3:me=umh:subme=8:trellis=1:psy-rd=0.0:aq-strength=0.6

   Low Quality -> deblock=1,1:ref=3:bframes=3:trellis=1:psy-rd=0.0:aq-strength=0.6

* 04-19-11 *
  * add "Output Location" button on the "Inputs" tab

* 04-07-11 *
  * added turbo first pass on the commandline code of "Target Bitrate" (or 2-pass mode) for more faster encoding on 2-pass mode

* 04-03-11 *
  * handbrake added support for ASS/SSA soft subbing so Cyko have it too now

* 03-30-11 *
  * updated the presets, high quality preset is same as --preset veryslow of x264 this will give more compression and quality gain at the cost of a little longer encoding time

* 03-03-11 *
  * the close button of the console window is now disabled so if you want to stop the encoding process just click "Abort Encoding" button on the GUI app

* 02-23-2011 *
  * target Filesize is remove due to handbrake developers plan to remove it, read more here ->  https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=20174 you can still use average Bitrate though its name on cyko is "Target Bitrate" 
  * HandbrakeCLI.exe detection is now better
  * remove the Width inputbox as it confuses newbies to encoding, resolution is in Height and in pixels anyway like 400p or 360p or 384p or 480p or 576p or etc.
  * rename "CRF" to "Target Quality"
  * rename "Bitrate" to "Target Bitrate"
* 11-11-10 *
